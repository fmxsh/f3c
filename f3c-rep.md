## Constitution

Thus, there is _conceptual syntax_ and _actual syntax_.
_f3c_ consists of a series of concepts and the conceptual structures arising from arranging various concepts. These form the _conceptual syntax_ of _f3c_.

_f3c_ also consists of the representational layer of characters, such as the characters you read right now. The _conceptual syntax_ is mapped to specific characters, thus defining what becomes the _actual syntax_, which is the syntax used to structure data in meaningful ways, such as `volume:100`.

_f3c_ also consists of the specific characters representing the data being contained by the actual syntax.

In summary, _f3c_ consists of all possible characters: Any valid byte sequence recognized by the host system's encoding configuration, including but not limited to UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ASCII, extended ANSI (ISO-8859 series), and arbitrary binary data (including null bytes \x00). Character interpretation depends on the system's locale (LC_CTYPE), encoding settings, and application behavior.

start OLD stuff:

### Pre-fundamental characters

Any valid byte sequence recognized by the host system's encoding configuration, including but not limited to UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ASCII, extended ANSI (ISO-8859 series), and arbitrary binary data (including null bytes \x00). Character interpretation depends on the system's locale (LC_CTYPE), encoding settings, and application behavior.

### Pre-fundamental sequence

A sequence of _pre-fundamental characters_

### Pre-fundamental line

As by POSIX. A sequence of _pre-fundamental characters_, or an empty sequence, that ends with a newline character (`\n`). A line can contain only one newline character. It follows that lines occur in sequence, one line following another.
